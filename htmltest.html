	Earth, or home, is the third planet from the sun. It is the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of liquid water on its surface, and, of course, life. Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system â€” smaller than the four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranusand Neptune, but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury, Marsand Venus.
